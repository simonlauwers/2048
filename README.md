## About
2048-clone made in first year of college at Karel de Grote Hogeschool, Antwerp.
## Structure
It is written in JavaFX and implements the model-view-presenter (MVP) architechtural pattern.
## Disclaimer
Comments and variable names are mostly in Dutch because this was a school project.
This project was made when I had barely any programming experience.
I am pushing this to my repos as a milestone for my first project with a UI.
